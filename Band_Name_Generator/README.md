# Band Name Generator

'Band Name Generator' is a terminal-based program that lets you generate your band's name. 

After starting 'Band Name Generator' in your terminal, the program will first ask you to enter the name of a town or city and then ask you 
for your pet's name (or enter a random name if you don't have a pet). 

Once that's done, the program will give you your band's name and ask you if you want to restart the process.
